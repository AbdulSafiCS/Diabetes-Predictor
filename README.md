Predicting Diabetes Risk Using Health Indicators

Diabetes is one of the leading chronic health conditions globally, posing a significant challenge for healthcare systems. Early diagnosis and effective prediction models can help manage and mitigate complications arising from diabetes. This project aims to build a predictive model using statistical methods and machine learning algorithms on a real-world dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

We performed a comprehensive data analysis pipeline that includes statistical exploration, preprocessing, feature selection, dimensionality reduction, and classification modeling. Our objective was to understand the relationships between various health indicators and the presence of diabetes, and to develop a reliable model that can predict the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on health survey data.

The dataset used in this project is the CDC Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset (UCI Dataset ID: 891). This dataset includes survey data collected from U.S. adults, focusing on behavioral and health indicators associated with diabetes risk.

The dataset contains 21 features which include:
1. Demographic features: Sex, Age, Education, Income
2. Behavioral features: Smoking, AlcoholDrinking, PhysicalActivity
3. Health conditions: BMI, Stroke, PhysicalHealth, MentalHealth, SleepTime
4. Chronic diseases and indicators: HighBP, HighChol, Asthma, KidneyDisease, SkinCancer
5. Target: Diabetes_binary: Binary classification label where 1 indicates the individual is diabetic and 0 indicates non-diabetic.
